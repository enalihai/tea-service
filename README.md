# Tea Service API  
Thank you for visiting my Tea Service API. This is a takehome challenge given by Turing School of Software and Design.  

The purpose of this takehome challenge is to create endpoints for a Front End team to consume.  

## Expected Endpoints  
1. Subscribe a Customer to a Tea Subscription
2. Cancel a Customer's Tea Subscription
3. See all of a Customer's Subscriptions both active and cancelled


## Project Constraints  
- 8 hours to create 3 endpoints

- Clear Documentation

- Project Boards Used  

- Restful Routes only  

- Full TDD  

- Explain OOP design descions  

## Project Schema  
- I decided to use Subscriptions as the connection between customers and tea, instead of having multiple joins tables, I was able to use a minimal database to accomplish my task.
